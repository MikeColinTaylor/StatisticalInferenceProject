A simulation exercise investigating the exponential distribution
========

```{r simulate the samples}

#First set the random number seed to make the results reproducible
set.seed(11)

#create a variable to store the results in
means = numeric()

#run 1000 simulations
for (i in 1:1000) {
  #store the mean of 40 exponentials to the means variable, using the rate 0.2
  means[i] <- mean(rexp(40, 0.2))
}

```
